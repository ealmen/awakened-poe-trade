# Awakened POE Trade with Windows 7 compatibility
Forked from https://github.com/SnosMe/awakened-poe-trade


I'm new to github, sorry for any noob-mistakes on github/forking best practices etc.  
I'm probably not the best person to keep win7 compatibility alive, but since no one else has stepped up I guess I'll do it.

Feel free to compile it yourself if you want, it's not that hard actually, and only needs a single line of code changed.  
Here is a guide on how to [compile it yourself](https://github.com/ealmen/awakened-poe-trade/blob/master/Compile%20it%20yourself.md).

I'm doing this mostly for myself, and to document the steps I've done to get this to work, for next league when I'll need it myself again.
